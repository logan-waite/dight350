                <p>The field of Digital Humanities could be split into two separate approaches to increasing knowledge in the humanities: the usage of digital advancements in technology to study older material, and the use of traditional techniques to study more contemporary subjects. While these fields are not the only ways to segment the fields, they constitute the main ways that many scholars of this day are approaching the constantly changing world of the humanities. In many ways, applying newer techniques to materials originally created and studied before the advent of computers increases the speed and effenciency with which new knowledge is garned. Coming from the other direction, as the digital world becomes more involved in the lives of humankind, tradional methods of study will allow us to better understand common events beyond what the newer methods can tell us.</p>
