                <p>In the past, when writing a research paper for the humanities, you would need to go to the library and spend hours upon hours looking in card catalogs and periodicals trying to find relevant information for what you were researching. This could be frustrating when you would run into dead ends, and was frigteningly ineffecient in finding information that was actually relevant. Now, however, web search engines have indexed a vast amount of the web, and work has been done to archive many of the materials that previously were only available in a physical form. From the comfort of your desk, you can search for information and can even view articles and artifacts that originated from the other side of the world. By applying a new technology to traditional processes, we are able to greatly facilitate the study of humanties.</p>
